While tutoring at local schools in Goleta, I saw firsthand how few of the students envisioned themselves in higher education, and how even fewer possessed the ability to advocate for themselves in the current education system. Many of the students were failing middle school and unable to advance to high school because they could not self-advocate to their teachers to meet graduation requirements. Much of the richness in my education came from the skillsets I acquired through speech and debate. With this in mind, I developed a curriculum that would build confidence in and inspire the next generation of leaders.",
