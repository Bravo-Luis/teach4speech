        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Teach4Speech is an organization that aims to
        bolster speech and communication skills in underrepresented elementary
        school students. While tutoring at local schools in Goleta, I saw
        firsthand how few of the students envisioned themselves in higher
        education, and how even fewer possessed the ability to advocate for
        themselves in the current education system. Many of the students were
        failing middle school and unable to advance to high school because they
        could not self-advocate to their teachers to meet graduation
        requirements. Unfortunately, classrooms and after-school programs did
        little to address this.
        <br /> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Much of the richness in my education
        came from the skillsets I acquired through speech and debate. With this
        in mind, I developed a curriculum that would build confidence in and
        inspire the next generation of leaders. The program takes the form of a
        10-week series of speech and debate games, which are specifically
        tailored to pique the interest of elementary school students. By the end
        of the program, students can give speeches at the front of the room with
        limited preparation, a skill that I believe is crucial in the
        empowerment of the next generation.
        <br /> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; In each school we have implemented
        Teach4Speech workshops in Santa Barbara, there was a measurable increase
        in the elementary studentsâ€™ willingness to come to the front of the room
        and voice their opinions. Their improvement motivated me to further
        develop and expand this initiative. I aim to make the program accessible
        to more communities, and create resources to meet specific student
        communication needs.
